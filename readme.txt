Easy to use drag & drop mega menu builder. Integrates with the existing WordPress 3 menu system. Responsive, retina & touch ready.

== Description ==

Mega Menu Plugin for WordPress. Use the built in drag & drop widget editor to build your mega panels.

Documentation & Demo: http://www.megamenu.co.uk

Features:

* Drag & drop widget editor 
* 6 column panels (wigets can span multiple columns)
* Flyout (traditional) or Mega Menu menu styles
* Menu Icons
* Activate Menu on either hover (intent) or click
* Compatible with touch screen devices
* 3 'down' arrow icon styles
* Built in theme editor
* Works with multiple menus on the same page
* Works with menus tagged to multiple Theme Locations
* < 1kb JavaScript when gzipped (also works when JS is disabled)
* Responsive
* Retina Ready
* Safe: You can uninstall and go back to your old menu
* Tested in IE9+, FireFox, Opera, Safari & Chrome (IE6, 7 & 8 are not supported but may work)

The technical stuff:

* Mega Menu will not pick up styling from your old menu, but the built in theme editor will allow you to tailor your Mega Menu styling to your theme.
* Your theme will need a registered Theme Location to work
* The menu CSS is dynamically parsed SCSS. Developers can create their own SCSS file if needed - just copy the megamenu.css file to your theme directory and make any required edits.
* The parsed SCSS is cached for performance. The cache is refreshed when a menu is saved or a theme has been created/updated.
* Mega Menu is compatible with Widget & Menu Output Cache plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-output-cache/) as well as WP Super Cache.
* Behind the scenes, all menu widgets are stored as standard WordPress widgets in a new widget area that the plugin creates.

Recommended Widgets:

* Image Widget
* Contact Form 7 Widget
* Very Simple Google Maps (this only gives a shortcode, so install the ShortCode Widget and use something like `[vsgmap address="your address, country" width='100%' height='200']`)

Tested with the 20 most popular themes, all compatible with the exceptions of:

* Tesla: compatible but requires edits: open header.php and remove the second call to wp_nav_menu (line 130 - 147)
* Vantage: compatible (but hover only)
* Stargazer: compatible (but hover only)
